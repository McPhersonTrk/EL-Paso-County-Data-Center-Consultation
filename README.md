- **Annual Cost**: $10,000 * 12 = $120,000

#### Storage Costs
- 100TB * $20/month = $2,000/month
- **Annual Cost**: $2,000 * 12 = $24,000

#### Networking Costs
- 10TB/month * $0.08/GB = $800/month
- **Annual Cost**: $800 * 12 = $9,600

#### Other Services Costs
- Monthly Cost: $5,000
- **Annual Cost**: $5,000 * 12 = $60,000

### Initial Annual Cost Estimate
- **Compute**: $120,000
- **Storage**: $24,000
- **Networking**: $9,600
- **Other Services**: $60,000
- **Total Initial Annual Cost**: $213,600

### Cost Increase Over 15 Years
To account for the 15% cost increase every three years, we will use the formula for compound interest:

**Future Value = Present Value × (1 + rate)^n**

Where:
- **Rate**: 15% or 0.15
- **n**: Number of periods (15 years / 3 years per period = 5 periods)

### Inflation-Adjusted Cost Increase
We will use the formula for compound interest to adjust for inflation:

**Future Value = Present Value × (1 + inflation rate)^n**

Where:
- **Inflation Rate**: 2.5% or 0.025
- **n**: Number of years

### Yearly Cost Estimates with Inflation
1. **Years 1-3**
    - No rate increase yet
    - **Yearly Cost**: $213,600

2. **Years 4-6**
    - 15% cost increase + 2.5% inflation compounded annually
    - **Yearly Cost**: $213,600 × 1.15 × (1.025)^3 = $264,603

3. **Years 7-9**
    - Another 15% cost increase + 2.5% inflation compounded annually
    - **Yearly Cost**: $264,603 × 1.15 × (1.025)^3 = $327,737

4. **Years 10-12**
    - Another 15% cost increase + 2.5% inflation compounded annually
    - **Yearly Cost**: $327,737 × 1.15 × (1.025)^3 = $405,522

5. **Years 13-15**
    - Another 15% cost increase + 2.5% inflation compounded annually
    - **Yearly Cost**: $405,522 × 1.15 × (1.025)^3 = $501,464

### Total 15-Year Cost with Inflation
Sum of all yearly costs:

**Total 15-Year Cost = (3 × $213,600) + (3 × $264,603) + (3 × $327,737) + (3 × $405,522) + (3 × $501,464)**

**Total 15-Year Cost = $5,138,778**

### Conclusion
The adjusted total cost estimate for using cloud service providers such as Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud Platform with comparable capabilities over a 15-year lifespan, accounting for a 15% cost increase every three years and an average annual inflation rate of 2.5%, is approximately $5.14 million.
